## Open Source

appreciate any feedback on the security and quality of our code. Feel

## Release a new version

* Checkout the `main` branch `git checkout main`
* Sync the repo with origin `git pull`
* Update the version file [`version.properties`](version.properties) with the new version
* Add the version file to the commit `git add version.properties`
* Commit the version update `git commit -m "Releasing version <x.y.z>"`, e.g. "Releasing version 1.2.3"
* Push the commit  `git push`
* Tag the commit `git tag v<x.y.z>`, e.g. "v1.2.3"
* Push the tag `git push origin v<x.y.z>`
* The new version will now be built by the CI and the signed bundle will be available as a build artefact for the tag
* Upload the bundle to the play console

## Building

There are two possible ways to build this project. Either it can be
opened using [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
or using gradle by manually installing the required build tools.

### Mapbox download key

As described
[here](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/guides/install/#configure-credentials)
it is required to configure a mapbox download key to be able to
compile the project with mapbox android SDK. The simplest way to
achieve this is to put it into the `.gradle/gradle.properties` file of
your home folder.
